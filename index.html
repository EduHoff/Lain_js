<pre style="font-size: 0.55em;">
    "Where am I vanishing into?" 
    Into a clam, quietly sleeping in the sea? 
    Last night's dream, I dreamt an unbelievably real one. 
    I'm just sleeping... 


    Town beyond the boundless horizon, nobody seems to be there. 
    Only the moon shines, and her light creates shadows. 
    Imagination, like illusions, starts overwhelming the town. 


    Holding inconsistency, wasted sense of value, 
    penetrates into the ground's surface so, so deeply. 
    "Where am I vanishing into?" 
    Truly, into a dark, calm layer. 


    But, wind, don't stop blowing yet. 
    Yeah, wind, don't stop blowing yet. 


    Gentleman with a rich chest living in an east mountain, 
    crowd of ladies wasting time for nothing. 
    Children creating a perfect evil, like a genius does, 
    river forms a flow but never needs water. 


    Purple time turns everything into the truth, 
    mysterious rumors floating in the skies. 
    Group of information creeping on the ground filled with noise. 
    Memories of a story that was never born. 


    Holding inconsistency, wasted sense of value, 
    penetrates into the ground's surface so, so deeply. 
    "Where am I vanishing into?" 
    Truly, into a dark, calm, layer. 


    But, wind, don't stop blowing yet. 
    Yeah, wind, don't stop blowing yet. 


    "What's he seeking?" "What does she understand?" 
    "You love me?" "I sure do, honey." 
    Satisfaction constantly creates loose portrayl. 


    A lake filled with mystery but not leading to the sea. 
    Thousands of molecules slash the darkness while giving ultrarapid lights. 
    "Who knew it?" "Everyone owns it in common." 
    Unnatural body and unconsciously developed technologies called "indifference".
    Value of enormous intelligence named "ignorance" is disregarded... 


    But, wind, don't stop blowing yet. 
    Yeah, wind, don't stop blowing yet...
